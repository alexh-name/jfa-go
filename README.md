This branch is for experimenting with [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land/) to possibly replace bootstrap in the future. Currently just working on the page structures, so none of this is actually usable in jfa-go yet.

#### currently done:
- [x] invites tab mockup (partially complete)
- [ ] accounts tab mockup
- [ ] settings tab mockup
- [ ] modals (may not use them at all, who knows)
- [ ] animations
